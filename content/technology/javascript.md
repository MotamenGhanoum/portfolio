#Javascript
JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.
JavaScript is commonly used for creating web pages. It allows us to add dynamic behavior to the webpage and add special effects to the webpage. On websites, it is mainly used for validation purposes. JavaScript helps us to execute complex actions and also enables the interaction of websites with visitors.
Example:


```js

<script>
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"The value of z is: " + z;
</script>

```
